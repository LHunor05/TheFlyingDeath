            <h1>Prior to the Accident</h1>
            <hr>
            <p><span class="intexthighlighting">Sunday, March 3, 1974, began as a routine day for Turkish Airlines
                    Flight 981</span>. The flight, operated by a
                McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, was scheduled to depart Istanbul and make its way to London Heathrow, with a
                stopover at Paris's Orly Airport to pick up additional passengers. Turkish Airlines, eager to compete in
                the burgeoning international aviation market, had promoted this flight as an affordable option for
                European and Asian travelers, attracting a diverse group of passengers. Among the <span
                    class="intexthighlighting">346 individuals
                    onboard</span> were families traveling for leisure, business professionals, and even a Japanese
                sports team
                returning from a tournament.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The DC-10, marketed as one of the most advanced wide-body aircraft of its time, was equipped with
                sophisticated avionics and a spacious cabin layout. However, the aircraft’s design also included a
                hidden flaw in its cargo door locking mechanism—a defect that had caused a similar incident months
                earlier but had not yet been fully addressed by the manufacturer. Flight 981's captain, <span
                    class="intexthighlighting">Nejat Berkoz</span>,
                was a veteran pilot with decades of experience, supported by <span class="intexthighlighting">First
                    Officer Ömer Subay and Flight
                    Engineer Erdal İnanç</span>. All three were seasoned professionals, and they carried out pre-flight
                checks
                meticulously, unaware of the hidden danger beneath the aircraft’s polished exterior.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The boarding process at Orly Airport was hectic but orderly, with passengers filling the aircraft to
                capacity. Spirits were high as the <span class="intexthighlighting">plane took off from Paris at 12:32
                    PM local time</span>. The crew and
                passengers alike anticipated a smooth journey, and the DC-10 ascended gracefully into the skies above
                France, cruising towards its final destination. In the cabin, travelers chatted, read magazines, and
                gazed out of the windows, completely unaware of the catastrophic chain of events that was about to
                unfold.</p>

            <h1>Crash</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Just minutes after takeoff, as Flight 981 reached its cruising altitude, disaster struck. <span
                    class="intexthighlighting">At
                    approximately 12:40 PM, a loud, deafening noise erupted from the rear of the aircraft. The rear left
                    cargo door, improperly secured due to the DC-10’s design flaw, tore away from the fuselage</span>.
                The
                resulting rapid decompression caused a section of the cabin floor above the cargo hold to collapse,
                severing critical control cables that linked the cockpit to the plane’s rear control surfaces.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>With the aircraft’s controls crippled, the pilots struggled desperately to regain command, but their
                efforts were in vain. The plane entered an uncontrollable descent, plummeting at an alarming rate toward
                the ground. Inside the cabin, chaos reigned as passengers and crew were thrown about violently. The
                oxygen masks failed to deploy in time, and panic swept through the aircraft in its final moments. <span
                    class="intexthighlighting">At
                    12:41 PM, the DC-10 slammed into the Ermenonville Forest</span>, just outside Paris, at an estimated
                speed of
                over 800 kilometers per hour. The impact was so severe that the aircraft disintegrated upon contact,
                scattering debris over a vast area.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><span class="intexthighlighting">The crash claimed the lives of all 346 people onboard</span>, making it
                the deadliest aviation disaster in
                history at the time. The aftermath left an indelible mark not only on the victims' families but also on
                the global aviation industry. The quiet forest of Ermenonville became the site of unspeakable tragedy,
                as rescue workers arrived to find a scene of devastation that would haunt them for years to come.</p>

            <h1>Cause</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The investigation into the crash of Flight 981 revealed that the <span class="intexthighlighting">primary
                    cause was the catastrophic
                    failure of the rear left cargo door</span>. The door, which was designed to latch mechanically and
                electrically, had a critical design flaw that allowed it to appear locked even when it wasn’t fully
                secure. During flight, the immense pressure difference between the cabin and the outside air caused the
                door to blow off. The resulting decompression collapsed part of the cabin floor, severing essential
                control cables that rendered the aircraft uncontrollable.</p>

                class="first-acc-pic intertextimage" title="American Airlines FLight 96 cargo door, same door malfunctioned in both flights">
            <hr>
            <p>This flaw had been identified months earlier in a similar incident involving another DC-10, but McDonnell
                Douglas, the aircraft’s manufacturer, had failed to implement sufficient corrective measures across all
                aircraft. Furthermore, maintenance practices and oversight at the time allowed the issue to go unnoticed
                during pre-flight inspections. Investigators also highlighted systemic issues in the aviation industry,
                including insufficient regulatory enforcement and cost-cutting measures that prioritized speed and
                efficiency over safety.</p>

            <h1>Aftermath</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The crash of Turkish Airlines Flight 981 sent shockwaves through the global community. In its immediate
                aftermath, grieving families demanded accountability, while aviation experts called for urgent reforms.
                Lawsuits were filed against McDonnell Douglas and Turkish Airlines, and intense scrutiny was placed on
                the regulatory bodies responsible for overseeing aircraft safety.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Within months, McDonnell Douglas issued mandatory modifications to the DC-10’s cargo door mechanism,
                addressing the design flaw that had caused the crash. International aviation authorities introduced
                stricter safety standards for cargo door inspections and certification processes. The tragedy also
                spurred advancements in decompression-resistant aircraft designs, ensuring that future planes could
                better withstand sudden pressure changes.</p>

            <h1>Legacy</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The legacy of Turkish Airlines Flight 981 lies in the sweeping changes it brought to aviation safety. The
                tragedy underscored the dire consequences of ignoring early warning signs and cutting corners in
                aircraft manufacturing and maintenance. It served as a stark reminder of the human cost of systemic
                failures and inspired a renewed commitment to passenger safety.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Today, the lessons learned from Flight 981 continue to shape the aviation industry. Modern aircraft are
                subjected to far more rigorous testing and certification processes, and safety protocols have become a
                cornerstone of airline operations. While the loss of 346 lives remains a solemn reminder of aviation’s
                past mistakes, it has also ensured that future generations of passengers can travel with greater
                confidence in the safety of the skies.</p>
