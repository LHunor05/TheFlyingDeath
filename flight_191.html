            <hr>
            <p><span class="intexthighlighting">May 25, 1979, was a clear and sunny day in Chicago</span>, bustling with
                the activity typical of O’Hare
                International Airport, one of the busiest transportation hubs in the world. Flight 191, operated by
                American Airlines, <span class="intexthighlighting">was scheduled to depart at 3:00 p.m. for Los Angeles
                    International Airport</span>. The
                aircraft assigned to this journey was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, an advanced wide-body jetliner popular
                in commercial aviation for its capacity and efficiency.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>The passengers on Flight 191 were a diverse group. Families, business travelers, and vacationers filled
                the seats, their anticipation blending with the hum of airport life. Boarding proceeded smoothly, with
                the flight crew greeting passengers with smiles, unaware of the significance this day would hold in
                aviation history. <span class="intexthighlighting">Captain Walter Lux</span>, a seasoned pilot with over
                22,000 flight hours, was at the
                controls, supported by <span class="intexthighlighting">First Officer James Dillard and Flight Engineer
                    Alfred Udovich</span>, both experienced
                and well-trained.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>As the clock ticked closer to the scheduled departure time, the DC-10 was cleared to taxi to the runway.
                The operations at O’Hare continued like clockwork; the ground crew ensured that luggage was loaded, the
                plane refueled, and final checks completed. Passengers settled into their seats, flipping through
                in-flight magazines, chatting quietly, or gazing out at the runways bustling with activity.</p>
            <hr>

            <p><span class="intexthighlighting">At 3:02 p.m., the aircraft began its takeoff roll down Runway
                    32R</span>. The engines roared to life, and the
                plane accelerated along the tarmac, heading toward what should have been a routine cross-country flight.
                Onboard, there was little to suggest anything unusual as the passengers experienced the familiar
                sensation of being pressed back into their seats during takeoff. For a brief moment, the flight lifted
                off the ground, beginning its ascent into a clear blue sky.

            <p><span class="intexthighlighting">But just as the aircraft climbed to about 300 feet, something went

            <h1>Crash</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Unbeknownst to those on board, <span class="intexthighlighting">the left engine—a massive General
                    Electric CF6—suddenly tore away from the
                    wing</span>, flipping over the top of the aircraft before crashing to the ground below. <span
                    class="intexthighlighting">The violent detachment
                    severed crucial hydraulic lines, disabling critical systems</span> that controlled the wing's
                leading-edge
                slats. These slats were essential for maintaining lift during takeoff. The pilots, with no way of
                knowing the full extent of the damage, found themselves in an increasingly dire situation.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Inside the cabin, chaos erupted. Passengers seated on the left side of the plane likely saw the engine
                fall away, while others were jolted by the sudden change in the aircraft’s behavior. Overhead bins
                rattled open, oxygen masks dangled uselessly as the cabin filled with confusion and fear.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>From the ground, onlookers saw the DC-10 veer to the left. Without the slats on the left wing, the plane
                couldn’t maintain lift evenly, causing it to roll dangerously to one side. The pilots fought to regain
                control, but the situation was insurmountable.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Within moments, Flight 191 had turned nearly upside down. Witnesses described a horrifying scene: the
                massive jet, engines screaming, plummeted nose-first into an open field just north of the airport. The
                impact was devastating. A fireball erupted, sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky, visible
                for miles around.</p>

            <h1>Cause</h1>
            <hr>
            <p><span class="intexthighlighting">The root cause of the crash was traced to a design flaw in the DC-10's
                    engine mount. The engine’s pylon,
                    which was responsible for holding the engine in place, was not adequately reinforced</span>. This
                flaw made it
                vulnerable to failure under the stress of flight, particularly during takeoff when the aircraft
                experiences maximum lift forces.</p>
            <hr>

                title="DC-10's pylon, that detached from Flight 191" class="intertextimage">
            <hr>
            <p>In particular, the failure of the hydraulic lines that powered the engine controls severed the connection
                to the engine, which led to the subsequent separation of the engine and wing. The National
                Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation concluded that this failure was the primary cause of
                the crash. In addition, the NTSB pointed to inadequate maintenance and inspection procedures, which
                allowed the faulty pylon to go unnoticed.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The crash prompted immediate changes in aircraft design, particularly with regard to the DC-10’s engine
                mounts. The FAA implemented stricter maintenance standards and required more frequent inspections of the
                aircraft's pylon and engine mount systems to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

            <h1>Aftermath</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Emergency responders arrived quickly, but there was little they could do. The crash was catastrophic—none
                of the 271 people on board survived, and two others on the ground were killed. The field where Flight
                191 came to rest was unrecognizable, littered with fragments of the aircraft, personal belongings, and a
                trail of destruction that would haunt all who witnessed it.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) arrived soon after, combing through
                the wreckage for clues. They discovered that improper maintenance during an earlier engine replacement
                had weakened the pylon holding the left engine to the wing. A crack had formed, and during takeoff, the
                immense stress proved too much.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1 id="legacy-id">Legacy</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The crash of Flight 191 remains one of the deadliest in U.S. aviation history. It was a tragic
                convergence of human error and mechanical failure, a stark reminder of the importance of rigorous
                maintenance and safety protocols. Yet, out of this disaster came significant changes in aviation
                practices, ensuring that such an event would be less likely to occur again.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>Today, the story of Flight 191 serves as a solemn chapter in the history of flight—a tale of lives lost
                but not forgotten, of lessons learned in the harshest way possible, and of the enduring pursuit of safer
                skies.</p>
