            <p>The DC-10, developed by McDonnell Douglas, emerged as a groundbreaking innovation in the aviation
                industry during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Its creation was driven by the demand for an advanced,
                larger, and more efficient jetliner to replace aging aircraft like the DC-8. Simultaneously, <span
                    class="intexthighlighting">McDonnell
                    Douglas aimed to compete with the Boeing 747</span>, which was making headlines as the first jumbo
                jet.
                Recognizing the need for a high-capacity aircraft that could handle both domestic and international
                routes, the company began designing the DC-10 with a passenger capacity ranging between 250 and 380
                seats, depending on the configuration.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The design of the DC-10 stood out due to its <span class="intexthighlighting">unique tri-jet
                    configuration</span>, featuring three engines: two
                mounted under each wing and a third integrated into the base of the vertical stabilizer at the tail.
                This arrangement balanced the need for sufficient power while maintaining fuel efficiency, which was a
                significant concern in the industry at the time. Engineers prioritized optimizing the aircraft’s range,
                enabling it to undertake long-haul flights while meeting the operational needs of major airlines.

            <h2>American Airlines Flight 96</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                On <span class="intexthighlighting">June 12, 1972</span>, American Airlines Flight 96 was en route from
                Detroit to New York when a cargo door failed to latch properly. The resulting explosive decompression
                caused the loss of the door and severe fuselage damage, which disabled the aircraft's hydraulic and
                control systems. Despite this, <span class="intexthighlighting">the crew managed to perform an emergency
                    landing</span> back at Detroit
                Metropolitan Airport, <span class="intexthighlighting">saving all 63 people on board</span>.

            <hr>
            <p>
                The investigation found that the cargo door latch failure was due to the design of the DC-10’s doors,
                which allowed pressure inside the plane to force the seal loose. In response, the FAA and McDonnell
                Douglas redesigned the cargo door locking mechanism and increased safety protocols to prevent similar
                incidents.
